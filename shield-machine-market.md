<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shield Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Slurry Shield Machines</li><li>Water-pressure Shield Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The shield machine market primarily comprises two types: slurry shield machines and water-pressure shield machines. Slurry shield machines utilize a mixture of water and bentonite to balance earth pressure during tunneling, making them ideal for soft ground conditions. In contrast, water-pressure shield machines use hydraulic pressure to support the tunnel face, effectively managing groundwater in saturated soils. Both types are essential for efficient underground excavation, ensuring stability and safety in various geological environments.</p></p>
