<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phototherapy Devices for Neonatal Jaundice Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phototherapy Lamp</li><li>Phototherapy Blanket</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phototherapy devices for neonatal jaundice primarily include phototherapy lamps and phototherapy blankets. Phototherapy lamps deliver targeted light to reduce bilirubin levels in infants through exposure. These lamps typically emit blue light, which is effective in converting bilirubin into a more water-soluble form for easier excretion. On the other hand, phototherapy blankets provide a more versatile and gentle approach, wrapping the infant in a fiberoptic blanket that emits light. Both methods aim to effectively manage neonatal jaundice and promote healthier outcomes.</p></p>
